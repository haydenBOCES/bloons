		<h1>Towers</h1>
		<p>In Bloons TD 6, you command different towers, be it monkey or machine, to dispose of the pesky Bloons. These include the various Heroes and towers that fall under 1 of 4 different classes: Primary, Military, Magic, and Support. Each tower preforms different actions and can be upgraded to suit different needs.</p>
		
		<h2>Heroes</h2>

		<p>Heroes are a unique type of tower that upgrade themselves over time. Only one hero of choice can be used in a game, but Heroes are more powerful and do not require money to be upgraded. The Heroes each have their own purpose, ranging from popping Bloons with great power, providing income, buffing other towers, or a combination of them. There are currently 14 Heroes in the game, including Quincy the Archer, Gwendolin the Pyromaniac, Striker Jones the Artillery Commander, Obyn Greenfoot the Forest Guardian, Captain Churchill the Tank, Benjamin the Code Monkey, Ezili the Voodoo Monkey, Pat Fusty the Giant Monkey, Adora the High Priestess, Admiral Brickell the Naval Commander, Etienne the Drone Operator, Sauda the Swordmaster, Psi the Psionic Monkey, and Geraldo the Mystic Shopkeeper.</p>
		
		<h2>Primary Towers</h2>
